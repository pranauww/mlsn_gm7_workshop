# üç∑ Fine-Tuning a Machine Learning Model ‚Äî Workshop

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning a Machine Learning Model** workshop! This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that walks you step-by-step through the process of improving a machine learning model by tuning its hyperparameters.

## üìò Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will:
- Train a baseline machine learning model using a real-world dataset
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Use Grid Search with Cross Validation to fine-tune hyperparameters
- Compare the baseline model to the tuned model
- Visualize feature importances to understand model behavior

This hands-on session is great for beginners who are familiar with Python and want to learn how to take their ML models to the next level!

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with no setup required.

### Steps:
1. Click the notebook file above and open it in Colab
2. Run each code cell sequentially
3. Follow along with the inline explanations

## üß† Topics Covered

- What is hyperparameter tuning?
- Building a baseline model
- Evaluation using classification metrics
- Grid Search with Cross Validation (`GridSearchCV`)
- Interpreting classification reports
- Visualizing feature importance in Random Forest

## üìä Dataset Used

We use the **Red Wine Quality Dataset**, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).  
This dataset contains physicochemical test results (e.g., pH, alcohol, citric acid) for 1,599 samples of red wine, with a quality score ranging from 0‚Äì10.

In the notebook, we convert this into a **binary classification problem** to predict if a wine sample is of **good quality** (quality ‚â• 7) or **not**.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python
- Familiarity with pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn is helpful
- No prior knowledge of hyperparameter tuning required
